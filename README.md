dockerfiles-centos-tools
========================

Dockerfile to build a very useful tools image on CentOS 7

[Tools image](http://developerblog.redhat.com/2015/03/11/introducing-the-rhel-container-for-rhel-atomic-host/) is intended to be used as [Super Privileged Container](http://developerblog.redhat.com/2014/11/06/introducing-a-super-privileged-container-concept/) (SPC) to extend the set of tools provided by Atomic Host. More tips how to use the image can be found at [Project Atomic blog](http://www.projectatomic.io/blog/2015/09/introducing-the-fedora-tools-image-for-fedora-atomic-host/).

To build, copy the sources down from GitHub and call:


```
    # docker build --rm -t eupraxialabs/tools:1.1 .
```

To run:

1. Not running on Atomic Host? Install the `atomic` tool with:
   ```
   # yum install atomic
   ```
2. If you are at Atomic Host, you have `atomic` tool pre-installed and thus you can directly call

   ```
   # atomic run eupraxialabs/tools:1.1
   ```

   to get a shell in the tools container, or

   ```
   # atomic run eupraxialabs/tools:1.1 <command>
   ```

   to run a specific command. For example:

   ```
   # atomic run eupraxialabs/tools:1.1 man systemd
   ```

`atomic` tool uses image labels to figure out the `docker run` command. You can check the [RUN label](https://github.com/projectatomic/atomic/blob/master/docs/atomic-run.1.md) by calling

```
docker inspect -f '{{.Config.Labels.RUN}}' eupraxialabs/tools
```
#### Special Tool in the Bag

Let's look at a special tool in the bag: ssh-import-id

As a brief introduction, 'ssh-import-id' is similar to the ssh-copy-id command.  'ssh-copy-id' pushes your public key into a remote ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file, whereas 'ssh-import-id' pulls a public key into the local ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.  In cloud instances, it's an efficient way to securely and conveniently retrieve and install your own SSH public key, or perhaps that of a colleague who needs access to the server.

The command 'ssh-import-id' will allow us to easy add users that need to ssh into any Atomic Host. It does this by pulling a public key from either Launchpad or GitHub and appending it to a <user>/.ssh/authorized_keys file.

```

[centos@atomic1 ~]$ docker exec -it <containerID> bash

[root@atomic1 /]# ssh-import-id gh:davidjbrewer --output /host/home/centos/.ssh/authorized_keys
2017-05-12 07:53:13,114 INFO Starting new HTTPS connection (1): api.github.com
2017-05-12 07:53:13,708 INFO Authorized key ['2048', '94:af:9f:fa:ca:77:93:3f:31:c3:0d:6f:c2:fd:0d:cc', 'davidjbrewer@github/15127404', '(RSA)']
2017-05-12 07:53:13,709 INFO [1] SSH keys [Authorized

```
Let's take a look:

```
[centos@atomic1 ~]$ cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCm/b4yF+BtZWlEbvLzTxouU0dPbCW+YOXgAJjPujSgHWSj/xzZj0jGgRzGKzWzYv1kEwbgF7t6T5tiMs8StVg1lLtjqRtRBtjRjzDqZbUuQ74n2sqE0tCk0r/TwYfPZBYXGIgJSV3/m8kkcg5j4uPp2v6ejGwOnVn0C/ud7lzie8BJtzMaXZqIrAqguP8EomBxI2zZgsUD/mFT1RTYFNNe6DNSQFJVP1hj6tVnCXEOsM5Rwz9T6Wu5jZ5wymx2F9V9V+H7PUBUAYHAFLdHZMgb/vWVeUzCrveIPnf/E47QI6F9sxXHJeSJ3+Ivn4b6rR/PXjUX3LhT/UIpyLHeixFd davidjbrewer@github/15127404 # ssh-import-id gh:davidjbrewer

```
As you can see, it's commented that the user's public key was added by the 'ssh-import-id' command.

This added a specific user's public portion of his ssh key and that user can now access the Atomic Host from the user's client machine.


```
$ ssh centos@atomic-master.eupraxialabs.com
Last login: Fri May 12 07:51:56 2017 from 192.168.0.151
[centos@atomic1 ~]$
```
The user can now successfully login without providing credentials.

This is an illustration of the use of 'ssh-import-id' and, of course, multiple users sharing the same user account is not a good practice.
User accounts should be created and the Atomic host SysAdmin will have their  public keys added to /home/<user>/.ssh/authorized keys.
